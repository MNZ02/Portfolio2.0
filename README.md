## 🛠 Installation & Set Up

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## 🧪 Development Modes

- `pnpm dev`: Webpack dev server (recommended for stable debugging).
- `pnpm dev:turbo`: Turbopack dev server (faster startup; may show sourcemap warnings on some setups).
- `pnpm dev:webpack`: Explicit webpack mode alias.

If you see logs like `chunk/module is missing a sourcemap`, that is typically a tooling-level warning in dev mode and not a production runtime issue.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
