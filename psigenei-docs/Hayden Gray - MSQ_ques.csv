"A function $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x^2 + 1}$, where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is the domain. The domain(s) on which the function $f(x)$ is one-to-one is/are \underline{\hspace{1cm}}.",,Natural numbers,Integers,Rational numbers,Irrational numbers,"A, B","The function f(x) is injective over natural numbers (A) and integers (B) because the monotonicity of f(x) ensures no repeated values. For rational and irrational numbers, f(x) is not guaranteed to remain one-to-one due to overlapping outputs in f(x).",Mathematics,Sets & Functions,Functions & Mappings,IIT JAM BT,2021,Analytical,1,100001
"Which of the following is/are TRUE about the electron carrier, ubiquinone (coenzyme Q)?",,"Its ability to accept two electrons, one at a time, enables ubiquinone to function at the junction between a 2-electron donor and a 1-electron acceptor","Being small and hydrophobic, ubiquinone readily shuttles between protein-based electron transfer complexes within the membrane",Its hydrophilic nature and high affinity for protons enable ubiquinone to transport protons readily within the intermembrane space of mitochondria,Its ability to interact with Heme C of cytochromes enables electron transport in the mitochondrial membrane,"A, B","Ubiquinone’s hydrophobic nature allows it to move within the membrane and transfer electrons (B). It accepts and donates electrons, bridging between 2-electron and 1-electron systems (A). It is not hydrophilic (C is false), and it does not interact with heme directly (D is false).",Biochemistry,Biomolecules - Carbohydrates,Monosachharides - Structure,IIT JAM BT,2020,Recall,2,100028
"The \Delta G^0' for homolactic fermentation converting glucose to lactate is −196kJ mol−1. If \Delta G^0' for the formation of ATP is +30.5kJ mol−1, then",,Homolactic fermentation is 31% energy efficient,The efficiency of energy conservation is 69%,The energy stored in the form of ATP is 31%,The process results in the loss of 31% of energy,A,"Total Energy Released: 196 kJ/mol. Energy Stored in ATP: 2 ATP molecules * 30.5 kJ/mol/ATP = 61 kJ/mol. Energy Efficiency = (Energy Stored / Total Energy Released) * 100%. Energy Efficiency = (61 kJ/mol / 196 kJ/mol) * 100% ≈ 31%. Therefore, the correct answer is:(A) Homolactic fermentation is 31% energy efficient.",Biochemistry,Biomolecules - Carbohydrates,Structural Polysachharides,IIT JAM BT,2017,Conceptual,2,100031
The advantage(s) of storing chemical energy in the form of starch and not as free glucose is/are that it ________.,,Minimizes diffusion,Enables compact storage,Reduces osmotic pressure,Protects against chemical reactivity of aldehyde groups,"A,B,C, D","Starch, being insoluble, prevents the high osmotic effects associated with glucose. Additionally, its compact structure is ideal for long-term energy storage, while minimizing chemical reactivity.",Biochemistry,Biomolecules - Carbohydrates,Structural Polysachharides,IIT JAM BT,2019,Application,3,100031
